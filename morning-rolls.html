          <h3>Method</h3>
          <ol class="method-list">
            <li>In a large bowl, rub the the flour and fat together, using your fingertips, until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast, salt & sugar, and stir through to combine.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, warm the milk & water over a low heat. You want the liquids to be warm but not boiling.</li>
            <li>Add the warm liquids to the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix to make a sticky dough (you may need to use your hands).</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and knead on a well-floured surface, for around 10 minutes, until smooth and pliable.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a clean bowl, before placing your dough in it.</li>
            <li>Cover with a piece of greased clingfilm, or a damp tea-towel.</li>
            <li>Leave the dough into a draught-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Prepare a large baking sheet, by very lightly greasing it before dusting with a generous amount of flour. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once your dough has doubled in size, knock it back (gently knead it for a moment to get the air back out of it).</li>
            <li>Then divide the dough into 8 pieces - you can eyeball this, or weigh your complete dough, divide that number by 8, then evenly weigh out each individual piece (this will give you more uniform rolls).</li>
            <li>Roll your pieces of dough between your hands to create ball shapes.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into an little flour if desired (optional), before placing each ball onto your prepared baking sheet, leaving a little bit of space between each.</li>
            <li>Loosely cover your rolls with a piece of greased cling film, or a damp tea-towel.</li>
            <li>Leave in a draught-free place for 1-2 hours, or until they have doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Once your rolls are about risen, pre-heat your oven to 230°c (210°c for fan assisted ovens, or Gas Mark 8).</li>
            <li>Remove the cling film/tea towel and place your rolls into your pre-heated oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until golden on top.</li>
            <li>Once baked, wrap your rolls into a clean tea towel and leave to cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
